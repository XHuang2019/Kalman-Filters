# Kalman-Filters

This project is to implement standard Kalman Filters mainly for real-time signal processing.

First version is a simple discrete-time standard KF based on the work of Hayk Martirosyan https://github.com/hmartiro/kalman-cpp.git.

Update on 01/09/2019: The standard KF has been tested on Windows, Visual Studio Community 2017. Need to import Eigen library first.
